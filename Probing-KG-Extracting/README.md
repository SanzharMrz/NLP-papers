```Probing tasks```, which have also been referred to as diagnostic classifiers, auxiliary classifier or decoding, is when you use the __encoded representations__ of one system to train another __classifier__ on some other (probing) task of interest. 

The probing task is designed in such a way to __isolate some linguistic phenomena__ and if the probing classifier performs well on the probing task we infer that the system has encoded the linguistic phenomena in question.
